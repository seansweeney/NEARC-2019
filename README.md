## Presentation Details ##
**Title:** Migrating AGOL User Accounts Using the ArcGIS API for Python  
**Time Slot:** Monday October 21, 2019 1:30pm - 2:00pm  
**Author:** Sean Sweeney, GIS Senior Programmer Analyst, City of Cambridge  

**Abstract:**	Cambridge is moving the majority of our ArcGIS Online users from AGOL logins to enterprise logins. Our goal is to move users in a controlled manner - not only their content, but their profile and other aspects of their AGOL identity - from their old AGOL login to their new enterprise account.  
  
I'll demonstrate some of the components of the ArcGIS API for Python we're using to accomplish this, point out a few curveballs we've run into along the way, and also show final Python script that (mostly) automates the process.
